# OurSpace

Our Space is a demo website. A private website or web application, only users who are involved with a company or organisation (which owes an admin access) should access this site and should be eligible to sign up in this website as a member of the company and organisation.
Yet it is an unfinished project, I'm sharing the UI/Layout/Design/Idea. I'm looking for suggestions or ideas to develop this site.
